- 👋 Hi, I’m @I-in-the-sky
- 👀 I’m interested in ... becoming a skilled programmer in order to develop games, softwares, apps, Dapps, metaverse
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... because I am an almost absolute beginner so I'm wondering which code should I learn first using a Mac (Swift? Python?)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... games, CCG games (I have one project 80% ready, but I need to involve graphics experts) and a didactic metaverse
- 📫 How to reach me ... I guess if you write me here I'll be notified and could answer you.
