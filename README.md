- 👋 Hi, I’m @I-in-the-sky, and - as you can see - I'm Italian 🤌 (not the criminal guy type, nor the cook guy type, more the not-feeling-Italian guy type)
- 👀 I’m interested in ... finding developers and build a dream team to develop games which I have ideas about, beginning with a New Cyberpunk CCG online game 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... no code sorry , I'm into learning German (well it's a language anyway)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... games! I have the idea for this aforementioned CCG game 80% ready, and I would also love to have a team to build an RPG simulation and reward-based like didactic game environment based on ministerial programs, so to also propose the Government a new way to match education and entertainment and revolutionize the didactic environment and methodology
- 📫 How to reach me ... I guess if you write me here I'll be notified about it and could answer you, or... you can check my projects page. :)
